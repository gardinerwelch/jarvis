 * Neural speech, entirely in the browser.

 * voice from over a decade ago. It is the honest ceiling of the built-in API
 * and it sounds like a satnav.
 *
 * Kokoro is an 82M-parameter TTS model that runs on WebGPU via ONNX. No cloud,
 * no API key, nothing leaves the machine — but it sounds like a person. It
 * carries four British male voices, which is what this project actually wants.
 *
 * The cost is a one-time model download — 310MB on WebGPU, 88MB without it,
 * for the reasons in load() — cached by the browser afterwards. It's fetched
 * during the boot sequence so the first "Hey Jarvis"
 * isn't waiting on it, and anything that goes wrong falls back to Daniel.

      // dependency), so the runtime's attempt to import its WebGPU backend from
      // there is blocked and Kokoro drops to the system voice.
      //
      // The shape of this override is load-bearing, and the obvious fix is the
      // wrong one. `wasmPaths` takes either a directory prefix (a string) or a
      // map naming the two files individually. onnxruntime-web's default browser
      // build already carries the loader script inline, but it only uses that
      // copy when it has been given neither a prefix nor an explicit loader path
      // — a prefix pushes it back onto fetching the loader as a module, and Vite
      // refuses to serve a module it did not process, wherever the file is put.
      // Naming only the binary keeps the inline loader and settles the one thing
      // that genuinely needs settling.
      //
      // `env.wasmPaths` here is kokoro-js's one-property passthrough to

      // model on that backend runs through a partial, lossy emulation. It
      // produces audio, which is why this looked fine for a while, but the
      // waveform is wrong: measured against the same model on the CPU backend,
      // q8-on-WebGPU came back 50ms short on an identical sentence (the
      // duration predictor itself had diverged) and carried 29% less
      // high-frequency energy. That is the muffled, mouth-full sound. It was
      // also, absurdly, the slowest configuration of the three — the emulation
      // costs more than it saves.
